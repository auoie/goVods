# Notes

## Reuse HTTP Connections

I issue `60 * num_of_domains` HTTP requests in the case of the StreamsCharts data.
This is wasteful.
It takes like 10 seconds.
I should probably reuse HTTP connections.
See [here](https://husni.dev/how-to-reuse-http-connection-in-go/).
You can see what's going on with

```bash
time ./govods sc-manual-get-m3u8 --time "02-10-2022 01:31" --streamer goonergooch --videoid 47238989357 --write
netstat -atn
```

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17948827/reusing-http-connections-in-go) for discussions and mistakes people made.

## HTTP/2 Multiplexing

It seems like there is something called HTTP/2 multiplexing.
You can issue multiple requests at the time time on a single TCP connection.
See [here](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/5T5aiDRl_cw).
They used Wireshark to assess this.

## Goroutines with Methods

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36121984/how-to-use-a-method-as-a-goroutine-function).

## HTTP Transport

See [here](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/tune-the-go-http-client-for-high-performance/#problem2-default-http-transport)
for remarks on the Go default transport.
