# README

This CLI tool helps obtain the M3U8 file for Twitch VODs.
It works even if a VOD is sub-only or unlisted.
If the VOD is not on the Twitch servers, (i.e. one of their S3 buckets),
then it is impossible to recover a VOD.

## Building

Build the binary.
If you don't want to build it, then just use `go run ./cmd/govods.go {stuff}`.

```bash
go build ./cmd/govods # Make the binary
./govods --help # View help
./govods sg-manual-get-m3u8 --help # View help for command sg-manual-get-m3u8
```

## Fetch a Single VOD

### Using SullyGnome

- Open the network tab in developer tools
- Go to `https://sullygnome.com/channel/{streamer}/streams`
- There should be a response with the XHR response type. View it.
- This response should have information about the recent streams in JSON format. It should include the following fields.
  ```jsonc
  {
    "startDateTime": "time", // start time of the stream in 2006-01-02T15:04:05Z format
    "streamId": "videoid" // video id of the stream
  }
  ```
- Then run the program with SullyGnome.
  ```bash
  # Using manually retrieved SullyGnome data, write the .m3u8 file to ./Downloads
  ./govods sg-manual-get-m3u8 --time {time} --streamer {streamer} --videoid {videoid}
  ```

### Using StreamsCharts

- Go to `https://streamscharts.com/channels/{streamer}/streams` to find a streamer's recent streams.
  Then go to the stream you want at `https://streamscharts.com/channels/{streamer}/streams/{videoid}`.
- Open the Elements Tab in the Chrome developer tools.
- Select the first `<time>` element with the `datetime` attribute.
  Then copy the `datetime` attribute. It should be in the format `02-01-2006 15:04`.
  You can get this value in the console with
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector("time[datetime]").getAttribute("datetime");
  ```
- Then run the program with StreamsCharts.
  ```bash
  # Using manually retrieved StreamCharts data, write the .m3u8 file to ./Downloads
  ./govods sc-manual-get-m3u8 --streamer {streamer} --videoid {videoid} --time {time}
  ```

### Using TwitchTracker

- Go to `https://twitchtracker.com/{streamer}/streams` for the streamer's streams.
- Open the Network tab in the Chrome developer tools.
  Then click on the stream you want.
- One of the responses should be the HTML. You can filter for it by clicking on the `Doc` filter near the top.
  Click on it. Then click on the response tab to show the actual HTML.
- Search for `Stream started` in the HTML. Right above it should be the start time in `2006-01-02 15:04:05` format.
- Then run the program with TwitchTracker.
  ```bash
  # Using manually retrieved TwitchTracker data, write the .m3u8 file to ./Downloads
  ./govods tt-manual-get-m3u8 --streamer {streamer} --videoid {videoid} --time {time}
  ```

## Fetching Many Vods

### Using stdin

You can pass in a JSON array with the structure:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "time": "2024-03-26T20:49:54Z",
    "id": "43903162955",
    "name": "streamer"
  },
  {
    "time": "2024-03-19T14:32:06Z",
    "id": "42424695993",
    "name": "streamer"
  }
  // ...
]
```

The easiest way to get this JSON is to find the streamer at `sullygnome.com`, click on Streams, open Dev Tools > Network Tab, then click on "past 90 days". Then a JSON request should show up in the Network Tab. The URL should look something like `https://sullygnome.com/api/tables/channeltables/streams/90/13643637/%20/1/1/desc/0/50`.
You can fetch this link with the [curl impersonate](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate) CLI tool.
Then you can use `jq` to transform it into the form above.
Then pass the output to the STDIN of the program.

```bash
LINK=https://sullygnome.com/api/tables/channeltables/streams/90/13643637/%20/1/1/desc/0/50
FILTER='[ .data[] | {time: .startDateTime, id: .streamId|tostring, name: .channelurl} ]'
curl_chrome116 "$LINK" | jq -r "$FILTER" | ./govods stdin
```

## Viewing or Downloading a VOD

Once we have fetched the files, we can serve them over a local web server.
For example, if you have `python3` installed locally, you can run

```bash
# Serve the files over a local web server
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory Downloads
```

Then you can see the files in `http://localhost:8080`.
If you're using Google Chrome, you can install the [Native HLS Playback](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/native-hls-playback/emnphkkblegpebimobpbekeedfgemhof) and then click on one of the files to play it.
Alternatively, you can use a media player such as MPV or VLC to play the files.

You can also download the VOD locally with `yt-dlp`.

```bash
# Play a file with MPV
mpv http://localhost:8080/{streamername}/{stuff}.m3u8
# Download the VOD
yt-dlp http://localhost:8080/{streamername}/{stuff}.m3u8 --concurrent-fragments 4
```

## Edge Cases

- _A VOD might be shorter than expected._ If a stream goes down for any length of time (even a few seconds), Twitch treats this as a new stream with a new `videoid`. In order to provide more accurate information, SullyGnome and TwitchTracker combine this into a single cast. `streamscharts.com` seems to be the only website that separates the two VODs. In this case, you should check `streamscharts.com` for the video ids.
- _A streamer changed their name._ In this case, you need to use the streamer's login name at the time the stream started.
- _A valid URL was found, but some segments are not playable._ If some of the segments are not playable, you can filter them out with the `--filter-invalid` flag, specifying the number of goroutines to use while checking the segments.
  For example,
  ```bash
  ./govods sg-manual-get-m3u8 --time {time} --streamer {streamer} --videoid {videoid} --filter-invalid 100
  ```
  This takes longer. It is slow if a lot of the segments are available.
  If a lot of the video is missing, it will be faster.
